# admix_simulation

This repo is for simulating how admixture affect hertability estimation 

## Genotype simulation 
folder: *genotype_simulation* <br />
Simulate genotype data with population struction and under random mating.

## Phenotype simulation
folder: *phenotype_simulation* <br />
Simulate phenotype data (traits) based on genotype data.

## How ancestry proportion affect heritability estimation?
folder: *anc_prop_heritability* <br />
Simulate random mating model with different admixture proportion

## Simple simulation with R
folder: *initial_simulation* <br />
Simulate random mating model with R, prototype of later simulation model

## Complexity added to the simple simulation
folder: *past_simulation* <br />
Stored past code that progressively adding complexity to the simple model: including assorative mating, different theta, generations, GCTA estimates, etc.
