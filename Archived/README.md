# admix_simulation Archived folder 

**Please ignore this folder.** This repo stores the history code for simulating how admixture affects the heritability of complex traits. This folder is for my reference only. Please check [**code**](https://github.com/jinguohuang/admix_heritability/tree/master/code/) for scripts for the manuscript.

## Genotype simulation 
folder: *genotype_simulation* <br />
Simulate genotype data with population structure and under random mating.

## Phenotype simulation
folder: *phenotype_simulation* <br />
Simulate phenotype data (traits) based on genotype data.

## How does ancestry proportion affect heritability estimation?
folder: *anc_prop_heritability* <br />
Simulate random mating model with different admixture proportion

## Simple simulation with R
folder: *initial_simulation* <br />
Simulate random mating model with R, the prototype of the later simulation model

## Complexity added to the simple simulation
folder: *past_simulation* <br />
Stored past code that progressively adding complexity to the simple model: including assortative mating, different theta, generations, GCTA estimates, etc.
